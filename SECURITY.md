# Security Policy

Franklin holds a wallet and spends real USDC, so we take reports seriously.
Thank you for helping keep its users safe.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report privately through GitHub:
**[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/Franklin/security/advisories/new)**
(Security tab → "Report a vulnerability").

If you cannot use GitHub, email **hello@blockrun.ai** with the subject
"Security report". Do not open a public issue, pull request or discussion for
a vulnerability.

A useful report includes:

- the affected version or commit
- steps to reproduce, or a proof of concept
- the impact you see (what an attacker can read, spend or change)

## What to expect

- **Acknowledgement within 48 hours.**
- An assessment and a fix plan within 7 days of confirming the issue.
- Fixes are developed in a private advisory fork and shipped in a patch
  release. The advisory is published after the fixed version is on npm.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release on npm (`@blockrun/franklin@latest`) receives security
fixes. Please upgrade before reporting.

## Recognition

We do not run a paid bug bounty. Reporters are credited by name in the
published GitHub advisory and in the release notes, unless they ask to stay
anonymous.

## Scope

In scope: this repository: the Franklin CLI, the local panel (`franklin
panel`), `franklin serve`, the desktop app, and how they handle wallet keys,
payments and spend limits.

Out of scope: vulnerabilities in third-party models, gateways or chains
Franklin talks to (report those to their owners); social engineering; and
denial of service that needs local access to the user's machine.
